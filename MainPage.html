            <p class="text-gray-500">Along with my team ENG4Life I competed in the York Engineering Competition in the Innovative Design category.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">The goal of the competition was to identify an issue present in our day-to-day lives and coming up with an</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">innovative solution. We identified the issue of wasted energy in subway stations as trains arrive and proposed the</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">solution of wind turbines to regain some of this energy. For our demonstration of this concept we came first and</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">won the competition. I chose to showcase this work as it demonstrates how I was able to effectively communicate </p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">our idea in a convincing and concise manner which caught the eyes of the judges allowing us to come in first place.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">By presenting our idea not only using our technical knowledge but also using effective communication we were</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">able to go above and beyond. This ultimately allowed our topic to be understood better as we used clear and</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">concise language to explain an otherwise complex topic.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Technical Report</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-500">In ENG 2003 we were tasked with writing a technical report on a topic from a list of 50. The topic I chose was the</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">dangers of fully Autonomous vehicles and their implications on society. I chose to showcase this piece because I</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">believe it highlights my ability as a communicator to take a complex topic such as autonomous systems and the various</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">risks associated with them and present it in a concise and clear way that can be understood by a variety of audiences</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">regardless of their technical knowledge/expertise. It also demonstrates how I am able to take research from a variety</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">of sources and present and draw conclusions from them which is a key aspect of communication.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Group Presentation</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-500">Extending from the Technical report in assignment 4 we were given groups in which we were to take our technical reports</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">and present them in a video. I chose this work to demonstrate how I am able to communicate my ideas not only in a written</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">format but also in a variety of mediums such as a video presentation. This shows an ability to transform one form of content</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">into a completely new form. Doing this requires a focus of both the content and research for the subject matter but also the</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">associated visuals and tone of voice to be intriguing while remaining informative.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-500">In ENG 2003 one of our assignments was to complete a mock video interview on the Kira Talent platform. In this interview we</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">would answer video questions by recording a video of ourselves answering the questions for which we only had 2 minutes to</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">prepare for. This demonstrates my communication skills as a had to remain concise in my answers while still delivering a</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">complete answer to the question. In addition to this due to the time constraint it was important to be clear and avoid stuttering</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">so that my answer could be memorable to a potential employer or hiring manager. Furthermore, since it was a video it was important</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500">to be presentable so that not only do I provide well-formed answers to the questions but also looking put together and prepared.</p>
